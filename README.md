# Luzon Language

This is an embedded language created in Kotlin to work with Java applications.
I created this language for my final year project at University. 

This project is still in progress so doesn't yet do much other than create an Abstract Syntax Tree and run some basic tests. 

More information about the project can be found [here](https://folio.brighton.ac.uk/user/ch629/luzon).
