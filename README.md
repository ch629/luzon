This is an embedded language created in Kotlin to work with Java applications.
I created this language for my final year project at University. 

This project is still in progress so doesn't yet have a lot of language features.
I currently have basic programming language functionality implemented. For example, expressions, simple classes and functions within classes. 
There are a lot of features I would like to add in the future, but due to time limitations with this as a University Project, I will be unlikely to do this until I am done. 

You can see examples of using the language within a project at [luzon-examples](https://www.github.com/ch629/luzon-examples)

More information about the project can be found [here](https://folio.brighton.ac.uk/user/ch629/luzon).
